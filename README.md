## About the Project
Homotopy Type Theory allows for a concrete definition of a group as a type of symmetries (self-identifications or automorphisms) of a given mathematical object. <br /> 
<br />
Group theory can be performed on the types of these objects, rather than on the sets of symmetries. <br /> 
This leads to novel approaches to classical problems and a new understanding of covariance in physics and mathematics.<br />
<br />
The goal of this project will be to formalize the Homotopy Type Theory approach to braid groups using Agda. <br /> 
The end goal will be to formalize [Schreier's theorem](https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottestfiles/Myers-2020-06-17-HoTTEST.pdf) , classifying extensions of a group $G$ by a group $K$ in terms of actions of $G$ on a type $BK$ of objects whose symmetries are the group $K$.
